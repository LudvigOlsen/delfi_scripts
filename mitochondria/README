The approach for calculating the fraction of fragments that are mitochondrial-derived
is adapted from Jiang et al, PNAS, 2015.

mito_statistics.sh : This script is to run a pipeline to extract reads mapped
                      to the mitochondria from ELAND bam files, realign them using Bowtie2,
                      and count the number of fragments aligned to chrM.  This script assumes
                      "mito_statistics.R" is in your working directory.

calc_frag_from_galp.R : This script script is to calculate the total number of fragments
                        in a GAlignmentPairs objects to use as a denominator for the 
                        number of high quality mitochondrial derived fragments.

summarize.R: Computes the proportion of fragments that are mitochondrial and saves that
             and other statistics as a text file.
